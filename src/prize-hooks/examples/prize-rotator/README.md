# Prize Rotator

## What is it?

People pool their funds together in a pod (safe or something) and then every draw one of the depositors is eligible to win the prizes for that draw.

## How will it work?

- the multisig deposits into przUSDC
- set a prize hook that iterates through the eligible addresses each draw and sends any prizes to that address
